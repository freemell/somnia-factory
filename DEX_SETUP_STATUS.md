# DEX Setup Status for Insomnia Trading Bot

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working
- **Router Contract**: `0x9726bc6F5ceff07dA975Ec666a6F967390814e4d` ✅ **DEPLOYED**
- **WETH Address**: `0xf4759546ca8D848156eb84cA4dfa66e6BC478452` ✅ **CONFIRMED**
- **Network Connectivity**: Somnia testnet RPC working ✅
- **ABI Configuration**: Updated with comprehensive Uniswap V2 functions ✅

### ❌ What's Not Working
- **Factory Contract**: `0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f` ❌ **NOT DEPLOYED**
- **Liquidity Detection**: Cannot detect pairs due to missing factory ❌
- **Swap Functionality**: Cannot execute swaps without factory ❌

## Root Cause Analysis

The QuickSwap deployment on Somnia testnet appears to be **incomplete**:
1. Router contract is deployed and functional
2. Factory contract is NOT deployed at the expected address
3. This prevents the bot from detecting existing liquidity pools
4. Users can add liquidity via UI but bot cannot detect it

## Updated Bot Configuration

### Files Updated
1. **`utils/abi.json`** - Comprehensive Uniswap V2 ABI ✅
2. **`utils/dex.js`** - Updated with correct addresses and error handling ✅
3. **Test scripts** - Created to verify contract deployment ✅

### Key Changes Made
- Updated factory address to: `0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f`
- Updated router address to: `0x9726bc6F5ceff07dA975Ec666a6F967390814e4d`
- Added contract deployment checks
- Enhanced error handling for missing contracts
- Created comprehensive ABI with all required functions

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Wait for Complete DEX Deployment
- Contact Somnia team to complete QuickSwap factory deployment
- Verify correct factory address once deployed
- Test liquidity detection after deployment

### Option 2: Use Alternative DEX
- Research if other DEX protocols are deployed on Somnia testnet
- Update bot to use alternative DEX addresses
- Test with new DEX implementation

### Option 3: Mock DEX for Testing
- Implement mock DEX functions for UI testing
- Use hardcoded liquidity data for development
- Switch to real DEX once deployed

## Current Bot Behavior

With the current setup, the bot will:
1. ✅ Connect to Somnia testnet successfully
2. ✅ Load correct ABI and addresses
3. ❌ Fail to detect liquidity pools (factory not deployed)
4. ❌ Show "No liquidity pool exists" for all token pairs
5. ❌ Cannot execute swaps

## Environment Variables Needed

Update your `.env` file with:
```
DEX_ROUTER=0x9726bc6F5ceff07dA975Ec666a6F967390814e4d
DEX_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f
WETH_ADDRESS=0xf4759546ca8D848156eb84cA4dfa66e6BC478452
```

## Testing Commands

Run these to verify the current status:
```bash
node test-contract-deployment.js    # Check contract deployment
node test-router.js                 # Test router functionality
node test-factory-getpair.js        # Test factory (will fail)
```

## Recommendation

**Immediate Action**: Contact the Somnia team to verify the correct factory address or confirm when the factory will be deployed. The router is working, but without the factory, the DEX cannot function properly.

**Alternative**: Consider implementing a mock DEX mode for development and testing until the real DEX is fully deployed.
